# posts by vikram

Very occasionally updated, (somewhat) useful stuff.

Although I like using squarespace for my main site, I'm not a fan of the way squarespace formats code. All posts here will be made via the magic of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

My main website can be found [here](https://www.vikram-baliga.com/).

## other info
- raw markdown files for each post can be found in `/_posts/`
- corresponding images (usually figures made in R) will be placed in `/images/`
